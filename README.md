# Lunar-Lander-DQN-DDQN
Deep Reinforcement Learning on Lunar Lander gym environment

This repo contains the files for the Deep Q-Network and Double Deep Q-Network used to solve the OpenAI Gym Environment called 'LunarLander-v2'.
I have used Experience Replay and Priortized Experience Replay for memory sampling.
